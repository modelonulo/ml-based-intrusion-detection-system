# Machine Learning Based Traffic Characterization

## Implementing an intrusion detection system to verify network traffic and classify it as benign or intrusion in real time.
- 'pcap-to-csv.py' file was used to extract the features from the _.pcap_ file and save them in a csv.
- 'ml-ids.ipynb' data pipeline from scratch to train and verify the best model for network flow characterization.

## Status 
this project is still in development ðŸš€ ...
- [x] Data collection from .pcap
- [x] Data preprocessing
    - [x] cleaning, some visualization, labeling
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Some machine learning algorithms

## Features
- to process data from _.pcap_ files
- to check for there are any internet attacks

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- to be added

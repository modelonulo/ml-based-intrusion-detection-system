# Machine learning based traffic characterization

##### Implementing an intrusion detection system to verify network traffic and classify it as benign or intrusion in real time.
- pcap-to-csv file was used to extract the features from the .pcap file and save them in a csv.
- ml-ids.ipynb data pipeline from scratch to train and verify the best model for network flow characterization.

## Status 
this project is still in production ðŸš€ ...
- [x] Data collection from .pcap
- [x] Data preprocessing
    - [x] cleaning, some visualization, labeling
- [ ] feature engineering
- [ ] some machine learning algorithms

## Features
- to get data from pcap files
- to check for there are any internet attacks

### ðŸ›  Requirements
- to be added
